Gazebo DvZ is updated regularly with gameplay changes, new features, bug fixes and quality of life improvements. This page lists significant additions and changes which affect gameplay or user experience, but generally does not list bug fixes, small tweaks, or behind-the-scenes changes which aren't noticeable in-game. You can also read about updates in the announcements channel on our community Discord server. Note that changes listed on this page may have been superseded by subsequent updates.

To keep this page a reasonable length, older updates will be periodically moved to archive pages - keep this in mind when linking to specific updates.
