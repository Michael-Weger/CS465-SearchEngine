'''Snowmen''' are [[Monsters#Special_Monsters|special monsters]] which spawn during the [[Events#Winter_Event|Winter Event]] with the ability to summon devastating snow squalls capable of damaging terrain and launching dwarves.

Snowmen are given the Snowman's Arm:
<br>
<br>
* With a left click, the Snowman will harness the power of winter and create a snow squall.
* Snow Squalls are large twisters which slowly advance forward launching dwarves high into the sky, and damage the terrain and dwarven constructs.

== Monster Role ==

* Snowmen should keep their distance from dwarves as they are extremely fraile. Launch snow squalls from a fair distance.
* Snowmen can aim snow squalls at walls to force any dwarves off as the snow squall approaches.

== Dwarven Strategy ==

* Snowmen should be a priority target for dwarves due to their ability to control vast amounts of space with their snow squalls.
* Much like getting launched by a [[Super Creeper|super creeper]], dwarves should try to land on higher ground than that which they were launched from to avoid death.
