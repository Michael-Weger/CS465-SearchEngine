'''Titles''' are earned through various means, and are added to a playerâ€™s name as a prefix (Title_Jimmy). All of these titles give a player a special item which has no considerable difference from the conventional weapons given to other Dwarves other than possibly appearance. 

Except for Mason, titles are earned on a season by season basis and are reset at the start of every new season. Each one has a corresponding title for the person with the most kills of each category.
