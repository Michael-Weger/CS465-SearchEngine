As long as there are at least 10 players in a Gazebo DvZ game, players can earn '''achievements'''. Achievements are earnable awards that recognize somewhat rarer events that occur to players and their team over the course of a game. Achievements cannot be earned until monsters are released, and the reward for doing them is server XP.

There are 4 categories of achievements; Dwarf, [[Heroes|Hero]], [[Monsters|Monster]], and General, and 3 levels of achievements; Common, Rare, and Team. Common achievements can be earned multiple times but only show for all players once when first unlocked, Rare can be unlocked and earned multiple times and shows for all players each time, and Team can be earned repeatedly and are unlocked as long as you are on the team it is earned for at that point of the game. 

Similar to achievements are [[quests]], which are achievements that run for a limited time but have progress persist from game to game in that time period. These are listed on their own page.

Achievements cannot be earned in [[Rush Mode]], or any game with fewer than 10 players.
