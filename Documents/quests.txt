Each month, there is an active '''quest''' which can be earned by players. Quest progress can only be made in the month that quest is active, but progress persists between games throughout that month, collectively adding to the final goal of quest and announcing a player's or the playerbase as a whole's completion of that quest as it would for [[achievements]]. Quests reward a high amount of experience, much more than that of any achievement.

Quest progress is tracked automatically, so you do not need to activate or opt into the quest before you play. You can check your progress by visiting the Quests NPC in the lobby. Quest progress is not tracked if the game is in [[Rush Mode]].

== Past Quests ==
